# Astro 497 Lab 6

## Exercise 1:  Explanatory Data Analysis:  Characterizing Planet Masses
- Work through ex1.jl (a Pluto notebook) on fitting radial velocity observations of 51 Pegasi.

## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Estimate parameter uncertainties using the bootstrap
- Assess a model using cross validation
- Estimate parameter uncertainties from posterior samples

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Characterizing the mass and orbit of an exoplanet using radial velocity observations
- Fitting non-linear models
- Performing Bayesian inference using a probabilistic programming language
- Assessing the convergence of Markov chains
